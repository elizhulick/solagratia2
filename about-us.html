                  CSA stands for “community supported agriculture” and is a partnership between you as a consumer and us, your local produce farm!  Folks sign up with us before the Spring growing season, usually between November and April (or until shares run out…and they will!) and then get weekly boxes of fresh produce, grown following organic practices, during the growing season.  Payment (installment plans available) is at the front end of the season, so seed, supplies and labor are available when needed.  Pickups are at the farm on Thursdays 3-6p, the Champaign Farmers Market on Tuesdays 3-6p or can be delivered on Thursdays, for a fee.  In addition to our veggies, we have “add-on” shares of local mushrooms and bread and will occasionally offer on-farm sales of local fruit, eggs, honey and sustainably-raised meat. <br> <br>

When you sign up for a veggie box with us, you are supporting your local economy, committing to healthy eating, trying new kinds of food, eating fresh and in season and saving money.  You also have an opportunity to volunteer on our farm and access to our events, including farm-to-table dinners, workshops, cooking classes and tours.  <br> <br>

By becoming a member with Sola Gratia Farm, you are also helping your neighbors in need.  Our farm was started by St. Matthew Lutheran Church in order to improve food security in our community.  Nearly 1 in 6 (now closer to 1 in 5 due to COVID) people in Champaign County are unsure of where their next meal is coming from and are less apt to spend limited food dollars on vegetables, which are nutrient dense but perishable.   Our farm fills an important need as we donate as much as 30% of our harvest each year to the Eastern Illinois Foodbank, Daily Bread Soup Kitchen and other food access partners. Over the last 11 years, we’ve donated over 135,000 pounds!

Join Sola Gratia Farm for a weekly box of the tastiest, freshest and most diverse veggies around and to be a part of building a strong, equitable food system as well.

                  Sola Gratia Farm grows nearly 50 different types of vegetables and over 125 different varieties!  Each week in our CSA and at market, our offerings are a little bit different.  Some of our crops are only available for a few weeks at a time (i.e. leeks and Brussel sprouts), some make repeat appearances in the Spring and Fall (i.e. radishes and beets), and some are considered more of a staple crop and once they start producing, are available until frost takes them out (i.e. tomatoes and peppers).

                 Sola Gratia Farm employs organic production methods that focus on growing an abundance of nutritious and delicious fruits and vegetables, while enhancing soil structure and biology.  We are committed to following organic practices in order to protect our workers, our customers, our neighbors and our shared environment.  We practice crop rotation to break pest cycles and balance nutrient cycling; use cover crops and organic fertilizers to build healthy soil; and employ integrated pest management techniques such as barriers, trap crops, beneficial insects, bait and traps to reduce the need for insecticide use (and then, only with organically approved insecticides).  Our seeds are always non-GMO and organic, as available, for the crops we grow.  
<br> <br>
We are in relationship with each of our customers through the CSA, farmer’s market and wholesale and retail accounts and being an urban farm, have a very high level of transparency and accountability.  Therefore, at this point in time, we have opted not to be certified by a third party and so technically, are not “certified organic”.

                  YES!  Many choices!  We usually have 5-7 options available for partial shares and 9-11 for full shares.  When we offer head lettuce, our members can often choose between leaf and romaine, red or green.  When we offer loose greens, our members can often choose between salad mix, spinach, arugula, or mustard.  When we offer roots, the choice will often be between carrots, beets, turnips, potatoes and kohlrabi.  When we offer bunching greens, members can choose between red and green kale, Swiss Chard and collard greens.  Herbs are always a choice of whatever is seasonal.  Pinted veggies are offered as choices, often between cherry tomatoes, tomatillos, hot peppers, okra, lunchbox peppers, etc.  Choose between Asian and Italian eggplant, purple or white.  Sweet or green peppers. Slicing or pickling cucumbers.  Zucchini, summer squash or pattypan. <br> <br>  When you walk through our CSA line, you’ll see the available choices in mixed bins, labeled with signs that tell our members how many of each to take.  Within that number, you can mix and match.  For example, 6 peppers could be 3 green and 3 red.  Two pints may allow okra AND cherry tomatoes to go home for dinner.  Four summer squash might mean two pattypans for grilling and two zucchini to bake with! <br> <br>

Because we grow such a large variety of veggies, we know our members will get something in their box they won’t be familiar with.  Our staff are always available at the time of CSA veggie box pickups and at market to share cooking ideas.  We also distribute a weekly CSA bulletin including a list of what is in the box each week, along with a few recipes.  For further inspiration, CSA members can check out the cooking classes on our website or attend a Farm to Table Dinner!
<br> <br>
CSA veggie boxes are a great way to eat fresh and seasonal and expand your palate!

                  Our biggest development in 2022 was announcing our farm expansion project and beginning the first stages of development. We’re so excited about this opportunity to upgrade our community farm so we can extend our educational reach, enhance our land stewardship, and grow more good food for our community. We also had a great field season in 2022, with our CSA program bigger than ever and our produce donations reaching more hunger abatement partners! Top that off with further extensions of our existing outreach and education programs (especially the CU Farm to School and Solidarity Gardens projects) and we’re very proud of what we’ve achieved this year!
